my side greek salad with the greek dressing was so tasty, and the pita and hummus was very refreshing.	
we ordered the duck rare and it was pink and tender on the inside with a nice char on the outside.	
he came running after us when he realized my husband had left his sunglasses on the table.	
their chow mein is so good!	
the portion was huge!
