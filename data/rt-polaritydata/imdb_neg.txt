a very , very , very slow moving , aimless movie about a distressed , drifting young man 
not sure who was more lost the flat characters or the audience , nearly half of whom walked out 
attempting artiness with black white and clever camera angles , the movie disappointed became even more ridiculous as the acting was poor and the plot and lines almost non existent 
very little music or anything to speak of 
the rest of the movie lacks art , charm , meaning if it 's about emptiness , it works i guess because it 's empty 
wasted two hours 
a bit predictable 
it had some average acting from the main person , and it was a low budget as you clearly can see 
this short film certainly pulls no punches 
graphics is far from the best part of the game 
today the graphics are crap 
this was a flick doomed from its conception 
the very idea of it was lame take a minor character from a mediocre pg 13 film , and make a complete non sequel while changing its tone to a pg rated family movie 
i was n't the least bit interested 
not only did it only confirm that the film would be unfunny and generic , but it also managed to give away the entire movie and i'm not exaggerating every moment , every plot point , every joke is told in the trailer 
but it 's just not funny 
but even the talented carrell ca n't save this 
his co stars do n't fare much better , with people like morgan freeman , jonah hill , and ed helms just wasted 
the story itself is just predictable and lazy 
the only real effects work is the presence of all the animals , and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious blue green screen work i 've ever seen 
but whatever it was that cost them so much , it did n't translate to quality , that 's for sure 
on the negative , it 's insipid enough to cause regret for another 2 hours of life wasted in front of the screen 
long , whiny and pointless 
but i recommend waiting for their future efforts , let this one go 
i was very disappointed in the movie 
one character is totally annoying with a voice that gives me the feeling of fingernails on a chalkboard 
there is a totally unnecessary train roller coaster scene 
there was absolutely no warmth or charm to these scenes or characters 
this movie totally grates on my nerves 
the performances are not improved by improvisation , because the actors now have twice as much to worry about not only whether they 're delivering the line well , but whether the line itself is any good 
and , quite honestly , often its not very good 
often the dialogue does n't really follow from one line to another , or fit the surroundings 
it crackles with an unpredictable , youthful energy but honestly , i found it hard to follow and concentrate on it meanders so badly 
i would n't say they 're worth 2 hours of your time , though 
i'm glad this pretentious piece of s did n't do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots it 's gonna help movie makers who are n't in the very restrained movie business of qu bec 
the problem was the script 
it was horrendous 
there was nothing believable about it at all 
the only suspense i was feeling was the frustration at just how retarded the girls were 
frankly , after cotton club and unfaithful , it was kind of embarrassing to watch lane and gere in this film , because it is bad 
the acting was bad , the dialogs were extremely shallow and insincere 
it was too predictable , even for a chick flick 
too politically correct 
very disappointing 
i love lane , but i 've never seen her in a movie this lousy 
an hour and a half i wish i could bring back 
the directing and the cinematography are n't quite as good 
the movie was so boring , that i sometimes found myself occupied peaking in the paper instead of watching \( never happened during a columbo movie before ! 
\) , and sometimes it was so embarrassing that i had to look away 
the directing seems too pretentious 
the scenes with the oh so mature neighbour girl are a misplace 
and generally the lines and plot is weaker than the average episode 
then scene where they debated whether or not to sack the trumpeter \( who falsely was accused for the murder \) is pure horror , really stupid 
my only problem is i thought the actor playing the villain was a low rent michael ironside 
however , this did n't make up for the fact that overall , this was a tremendously boring movie 
there was no chemistry between ben affleck and sandra bullock in this film , and i could n't understand why he would consider even leaving his wife to be for this chick that he supposedly was knocked out by 
there were several moments in the movie that just did n't need to be there and were excruciatingly slow moving 
this was a poor remake of my best friends wedding 
all in all , a great disappointment 
i cannot believe that the actors agreed to do this film 
i could not stand to even watch it for very long for fear of losing i q 
i guess that nobody at the network that aired this dribble watched it before putting it on 
imdb ratings only go as low 1 for awful , it 's time to get some negative numbers in there for cases such as these 
i saw mirrormask last night and it was an unsatisfactory experience 
unfortunately , inexperience of direction meant that scene after scene passed with little in the way of dramatic tension or conflict 
these are the central themes of the film and they are handled ineptly , stereotypically and with no depth of imagination 
all the pretty pictures in the world cannot make up for a piece of work that is flawed at the core 
it is an hour and half waste of time , following a bunch of very pretty high schoolers whine and cry about life 
you ca n't relate with them , hell you barely can understand them 
this movie is a pure disaster , the story is stupid and the editing is the worst i have seen , it confuses you incredibly 
the fish is badly made and some of its underwater shots are repeated a thousand times in the film 
a truly , truly bad film 
the acting is terrible , and the writing is worse 
the only possible way this movie could be redeemed would be as mst3k fodder 
i paid too much 
it was so boring ! 
no plot whatsoever ! 
again , no plot at all 
horrible ! 
worst hour and a half of my life ! oh my gosh ! 
i had to walk out of the theatre for a few minutes just to get some relief ! 
i hate movies like that 
yeah , the movie pretty much sucked 
there is no plot or storyline ! ! 
if you do go see this movie , bring a pillow or a girlfriend boyfriend to keep you occupied through out 
awful 
i do n't think i 've ever gone to a movie and disliked it as much 
it was a good thing that the tickets only cost five dollars because i would be mad if i 'd have paid 7 50 to see this crap 
nobody identifies with these characters because they 're all cardboard cutouts and stereotypes \( or predictably reverse stereotypes \) 
this is a bad film , with bad writing , and good actors an ugly cartoon crafted by paul haggis for people who ca n't handle anything but the bold strokes in storytelling a picture painted with crayons 
crash is a depressing little nothing , that provokes emotion , but teaches you nothing if you already know racism and prejudice are bad things 
your brain will attempt to shut down as part of a primal impulse of self preservation 
i was left shattered from the experience of watching this 'film' and i took a good two hours to fully recover 
this movie now joins revenge of the boogeyman and zombiez as part of the hellish trinity of horror films 
i certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way 
i mean this in a terrible way 
this film has no redeeming features 
everything is appalling 
artless camera work endlessly presents us with the ugliest setting imaginable , i e 
the story is beyond stupid 
the script is was there a script \? 
the kids are annoying 
the lead man is charisma free 
utterly without merit on any level , this is akin to torture 
i 'll even say it again this is torture 
maybe there would be a reasonable explanation for this atrocity 
not a pleasant voyage of self discovery 
highly unrecommended 
if this premise sound stupid , that 's because it is 
yes , it 's that bad 
nothing at all to recommend 
this movie suffered because of the writing , it needed more suspense 
there were too many close ups 
but other than that the movie seemed to drag and the heroes did n't really work for their freedom 
but this movie is definitely a below average rent 
this movie is bad 
so bad 
the film is way too long 
this is definitely one of the bad ones 
i really do n't see how anyone could enjoy this movie 
i do n't think i 've ever seen a movie half as boring as this self indulgent piece of junk 
it probably would have been better if the director had n't spent most of the movie showcasing his own art work , which really is n't that noteworthy 
another thing i did n't really like is when a character got punched in the face , a gallon of blood would spew forth soon after 
ironically i mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch 
it 's this pandering to the audience that sabotages most of his films 
hence the whole story lacks a certain energy 
the plot simply rumbles on like a machine , desperately depending on the addition of new scenes 
there are the usual hitchcock logic flaws 
mishima is extremely uninteresting 
this is a chilly , unremarkable movie about an author living working in a chilly abstruse culture 
the flat reenactments do n't hold your attention because they are emotionally adrift and stagy 
and the rest of it just sits there being awful with soldiers singing songs about the masculinity they pledge themselves to , hairsplitting about purity , the admiration of swords , etc 
he can bore you to pieces , and kill the momentum of a movie , quicker than anyone else 
schrader has made a resume full of lousy , amateurish films 
however , i recently watched the whole thing again on dvd , and i was completely struck by how extremely stupid the storyline was how it contained holes , inconsistencies and frankly a whole lot of crap and how horrid the dancing was 
i mean , in a realistic world , she would never have gotten into that ballet repertory the whole thing was quite pathetic 
the character developments also lacked in depth 
woa , talk about awful 
do not waste your time 
it was just too horrible 
the worst , sappiest dialogue i could go on and on 
but what really made it unwatchable was the direction 
the poor actors 
you ca n't even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action 
if you check the director 's filmography on this site you will see why this film did n't have a chance 
this would not even be good as a made for tv flick 
regrettably , the film fails 
the movie lacks visual interest , drama , expression of feeling , and celebration of the very patriotism that underlines the narrative 
no actress has been worse used that june allison in this movie 
unfortunately , this is a bad movie that is just plain bad 
bad script , bad direction and horrible acting make this one plain bad ! 
the dialogue sucked 
the cinematography if it can be called that sucked 
the soundtrack sucked 
the acting sucked 
the concert sequences just sucked 
overall , this movie was cheap trash 
but this movie is not funny , considering the ridiculousness of it 
i came out of it feeling angry 
i'm not sure what he was trying to do with this film 
if it was to turn my good day feeling into a night of disturbing memories than i guess he succeeded 
it was forced , like everything in this movie 
again , lame 
here 's where the movie really pi ed me off 
and do n't even get me started on the jerky camerawork 
when i saw it in the theater i thought i was going to be sick 
summary the witticisms were n't witty 
the plot well , i said i 'd let that one go 
the acting was bad 
really bad 
even billy bob could n't rise above the script , which was worse 
camerawork again , bad 
rating 1 out of 10 
i literally vomited while watching this film 
i'm translating movies for a living and this is the first movie in my 5 year working experience that i found offensive to my intelligence 
but when someone strives for greatness and poetry , but delivers a muddled \( and often ridiculous \) story , a bunch of disparate scenes , pretentious dialogue then you get the worst kind of a movie that some other reviewer very accurately defined as pretentious crap 
to those who find this movie intelligent or even masterful , i can only say it 's your intelligence and your imagination you obviously used to try and make some sense of this pitiful attempt \( it 's in our human nature to try and make sense of things \) 
one more thing i can tolerate political incorrectness very well , i'm all for artistic freedom and suspension of disbelief , but the slavic female character was just too much 
which has more depth and character than the man underneath it 
the malta settings are as dry and as barren as the dialogue 
this movie is terrible 
the hockey scenes are terrible , defensemen playing like they 're 5 years old , goalies diving at shots that are 10 feet wide of the net , etc 
for those that have n't seen it , do n't waste your time ! 
to call this movie a drama is ridiculous ! 
started watching this but did n't believe in any of the characters 
in particular the relationship between the bakery assistant and the waitress just did n't work for me at all 
it was a very superficial movie and it gave me the feeling that i was watching play rather than a film 
the characters were very 'stagey' and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce 
by the time the pyromaniac waylaid the assistant i was bored and did n't care what happened next and so i switched off 
glad i did n't pay to see it 
did n't laugh or even smile once 
but it was n't anything at all just one big yawn 
but storm trooper is not even bad enough to make it to the list of wonderfully terrible movies 
it 's just lame 
the guy who said he 's had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right 
everything about this movie is stupid 
even if you love bad movies , do not watch this movie 
it is shameful 
the new characters were n't all that memorable , and i found myself forgetting who was who 
i felt as though her going to ireland did absolutely nothing whatsoever 
it did n't make me scared , horrified , or make me sympathetic towards the characters it was simply annoying 
the jerky camera movements were also annoying 
the plot was the same as pretty much every other cheap horror 
there was a few pathetic attempts to give the characters some depth , but it did n't really work into the rest of the plot 
i guess it was supposed to be clever twist , then shed some light on the situation , but it was just stupid 
if you see it , you should probably just leave it on the shelf 
this totally unfunny movie is so over the top and pathetic and unrealistic that throughout the whole 90 minutes of utter torture i probably looked at my watch about 70000 times ! 
lucy bell is so much higher than this crap and for her to sink this low is quite depressing 
all this movie does is make you sick watching all these slackers make excuses for their stupid actions for 90 minutes 
god , and i can never get that 90 minutes back ! 
almost all of the songs in cover girl are old fashioned and not very tuneful 
the most annoying thing about 'cover girl' is the way in which rita hayworth is put up on a pedestal 
unfortunately , 'cover girl' is an example of how hollywood used to exploit women for financial gain 
i could n't take them seriously 
i am a fan of his this movie sucked really bad 
even worse than ticker ! 
that movie was bad 
only like 3 or 4 buildings used , a couple of locations maybe , poor hummh ! 
it just blew 
now we were chosen to be tortured with this disgusting piece of blatant american propaganda 
this show is made for americans it is too stupid and full with hatred and clich s to be admitted elsewhere 
almost everyone involved must be return to school , acting is utterly predictable and bad , script is pile of garbage all round 
i wish i could enter negative values , admins \? 
the sets are so bad , they would n't look out of place on a thunderbirds episode 
oh yeah , and the storyline was pathetic too 
i hate writing bad reviews about films especially those in which i really like the star but this film is so bad i do n't believe for one second that anyone could have been proud of it 
i am not a filmmaker nor am i a director but i would hide my head in the sand if i 'd spent whatever amount of money and time on this movie 
in short this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film 
it came free with a dvd player i bought but i still turned the thing off halfway through because i was embarrassed for howell 
1 10 and only because there is no setting for 0 10 
but the acting even that of such professionals as drago and debbie rochon was terrible , the directing worse \( perhaps contributory to the former \) , the dialog chimp like , and the camera work , barely tolerable 
yes , i am simplifying things here for the sake of brevity , for this really is at the core of the problems with this film it has too much going on without any real , fulfilling explanation 
but the convoluted plot just did n't convince me , and much of the film was watched with a weird , questioning glance 
i let my girlfriend talk me into seeing this bad idea , we both hated it 
bela lugosi was totally extraneous , intoning odd lines 
the acting was decidely wooden , though no worse than a period universal b movie 
wow , what a bad film 
not frightening in the least , and barely comprehensible 
the plot does n't hang together at all , and the acting is absolutely appalling 
not even good for camp value ! 
i was n't expecting oscar material , but this \? 
you 'd have to have the iq of particularly stupid mollusk not to see that one coming 
this film \( and i use that word loosely \) is an insult to the movie going public 
if only someone involved with it knew how to string together narrative ! 
this gets a 1 out of 10 , simply because there 's nothing lower 
this is one i did not have , but i watched it recently on fox movie channel , and was very disappointed 
i know he was a contract player with little control over his scripts , but the acting was as bad as the script 
victor mclaglen was even bad , and brian donlevy was almost unrecognizable 
considering the relations off screen between taylor and stanwyck , it was surprising how little chemistry there was on screen between the two of them 
but the premise of the film was so ridiculous that the president of the u s 
the death row scenes were entirely unmoving 
the only thing worse than taylor 's acting was stanwyck 's singing 
whatever the producer was going for , he missed entirely 
a cheap and cheerless heist movie with poor characterisation , lots of underbite style stoic emoting \( think chow yun fat in a better tomorrow \) and some cheesy clich s thrown into an abandoned factory ready for a few poorly executed flying judo rolls a la john woo 
even the squibs look awful 
at no point in the proceedings does it look remotely like america 
the plot , such as it is , is so derivative and predictable that the ending is like a mercy killing 
the awful dialogue and hopeless overacting by everyone who gets shot top off a real waste of space and time 
i was very uneasy with how bad this movie was , but not scared at all 
the dialogue is composed of things that make little sense 
about 30 minutes of footage is wasted to show mediocre elderly actors awkwardly babbling overwrought pseudo satanic gibberish corny enough to make a teen goth blush , almost always in olde english , and sometimes in latin that may or may not be made up words 
the directing is sloppy at best 
hackneyed writing , certainly , but made even worse by the bad directing 
of course , the acting is blah 
the acting by the whole cast could be put on a scale and balanced perfectly between overacting and underacting 
and , finally , after all that , we get to an ending that would 've been great had it been handled by competent people and not jerry falwell 
i particularly remember my senses being assaulted by strident cords of music that would blare out with very little warning , and even less meaning 
it is just the sort of pap that is screened in the afternoon to punish the unemployed for not having jobs 
about ten minutes into this film i started having second thoughts 
about half way through this film i started to dislike it 
by the time the film ended , i not only disliked it , i despised it 
what this film lacks is a convincing script 
the script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed 
things happen , characters personalities change , plot twists occur for no real reason other than that script calls for it 
this is probably the most irritating show i have ever seen in my entire life 
it is indescribably the most annoying and idiotic show i have ever seen 
everything about it is just bad 
i could not understand , what kind of idiot would produce this mess in the first place not to mention several season 
the script is bad , very bad it contains both cheesiness and unethical joke that you normally see in rated r or nc 17 movie 
the casting is also horrible , cause all you see is a really really bad actors , period 
final word this show is a real torture ! ! 
it is zillion times away from reality 
watching washing machine twirling around would n't hurt your eyes as much as this show 
rating 0 10 \( grade z \) note the show is so bad that even mother of the cast pull her daughter out of the show 
20th century fox 's road house 1948 \) is not only quite a silly noir but is an implausible unmitigated bore of a movie 
full of unconvincing cardboard characters it is blandly written by edward chodorov , who also produced , and is surprisingly directed by jean negulesco from whom one would expect a great deal more 
from here on the widmark character turns unintentionally comical ! 
his losing his marbles so early in the proceedings is totally implausible and unconvincing 
and if that is n't enough of a mess of a movie for you the picture is also marred with a constant use of studio sets and indoor exteriors 
whatever prompted such a documentary is beyond me ! 
\( very serious spoilers \) this movie was a huge disappointment 
there are so many problems i dont know where to start 
but the movie makes a lot of serious mistakes 
first of all , there are enough racial stereotypes and racial jokes to offend everyone 
the movie is littered with overt racial slurs towards the black cast members and in return the whites are depicted as morons and boobs 
putting the race card aside , lets look at the major flaw in the film they destroy latifa 's character 
there is no real plot 
i wouldnt see this movie again for free 
the bipolarity of the ruthless thug \( one minute a ruthless killer , the next minute a luv 's diaper commercial \) is completely unconvincing 
i'm terribly disappointed that this film would receive so many awards and accolades , especially when there are far more deserving works of film out there 
i do n't think there are any redeeming qualities in this remake 
this may be the only bad film he ever made 
so bad well it 's just bad 
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very , very bad idea all the way 
it 's a shame to see good actors like thomerson and james make a living in a mess like this 
i thought it was bad 
both films are terrible , but to the credit of the 1986 version , it was watchable 
let 's start with all the problems the acting , especially from the lead professor , was very , very bad 
the script is a big flawed mess 
the best example of how dumb the writing is when it 's established that you can turn the zombie students back into humans by removing a necklace containing a piece of the meteorite 
director paul matthews , who also wrote directed the weak 1995 monster movie grim , clearly does n't know how to pace his films 
the movie is terribly boring in places 
the lighting is awful 
the film looks cheap and bland 
one of the most disappointing aspects is the lack of notable gore 
this convention never worked well in the past , and certainly does n't work here 
the visual effects were awful 
the cg opening sequence in space looked like it could have been created on microsoft slideshow for god 's sake ! 
the explosion of the gas tanks at the end was just as awful 
to sum the film up , breeders is a terrible , cheaply made horror movie that should be avoided like the ebola virus 
not recommended 
he is almost unbearable to watch on screen , he has little to no charisma , and terrible comedic timing 
aside from it 's terrible lead , this film has loads of other debits 
i understand that it 's supposed to be a cheap popcorn comedy , but that does n't mean that it has to completely insult our intelligence , and have writing so incredibly hackneyed that it borders on offensive 
lewis black 's considerable talent is wasted here too , as he is at his most incendiary when he is unrestrained , which the pg 13 rating certainly wo n't allow 
with the originality and freshness of the first movie now spent , this remake had little else to offer 
the budget was evidently very limited 
this was reflected not only in the cast , but also in the below par script , which borrowed much from the earlier classic 
however , here there was no decent acting , action or location work to balance things up 
filmiing was less expansive 
it failed to convey the broad sweep of landscapes that were a great part of the original 
generally it just lacked imagination 
not recommended 
is it possible for a movie to get any worse than this \? 
there is no plot here to keep you going in the first place 
even when the women finally show up , there is no sign of improvement the most expected things happen and by the time the film is over , you might be far asleep 
beware this is not a trashy cult movie , this is trash period ! 
i ca n't believe there 's even a sequel to this ! 
which is precisely why i am giving it such a bad review ! 
every element of this story was so over the top , excessively phony and contrived that it was painful to sit through 
her lines seem to have been written by a fifteen year old , though they are trying oh so , so hard to sound like how a fifteen year old would really , um , you know , well talk 
there is simply no excuse for something this poorly done 
i saw this movie and i thought this is a stupid movie 
what is even more stupid is that who had thought an idea that there should be a volcano in los angeles \? 
to be honest with you , this is unbelievable nonsense and very foolish 
in conclusion , i will not bother with this movie because a volcano in los angeles is nothing but nonsense 
the story line is just awful ! 
it 's just painful ! 
and the accents are absolutely abysmal ! 
there 's also enough hypocrisy in this film to make me vomit 
do n't waste your time watching this rubbish non researched film 
omit watching this 
my rating just 3 out of 10 
the basic premise is wasted since it is sidelined by the inexplicable focus on the documentary crew 
regardless , the film fails on most levels 
avoid at all costs 
i know that jim o'connor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him , but george was well dull 
he really did n't seem to want to be hosting his voice overs were monotonous , did n't get involved with the guests 
this movie is so mind bendingly awful , it could n't have even been created 
the film lacks any real scares or tension some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself 
the least said about the acting the better 
even allowing for poor production values for the time \( 1971 \) and the format \( some kind of mini series \) , this is baaaaaad 
unless you 're just out to visually collect all extant films of austen 's work , you can skip this one 
it is not good 
speaking of the music , it is unbearably predictably and kitchy 
then the film just dropped the ball 
there are many continuity errors one other user commented on different cars in the garage , joe 's glasses the one that got to me the most was the fact joe 's facial hair configuration seemed to change from scene to scene 
i ca n't see how this movie can be an inspiration to anyone to come out or overcome fear and rejection 
it 's so bad it 's actually worth seeing just for that reason 
well just if you keep thinking how bad it is 
it 's a mediocre , miserable , hollow , laughable and predictable piece of garbage 
it 's a case of 'so bad it is laughable' 
\) very bad performance plays angela bennett , a computer expert who is at home all the time 
it is a film about nothing , just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 
how awful she is ! 
but she is still a bad actress , repeating her robotic face moves in each of her pictures 
the results , well , are a shame 
delete this film from your mind ! 
one of the worst shows of all time 
the show would begin with smart ass ed comments to each other that would be totally off the wall and uncalled for 
the fat computer geek was unbelievable , the bible thumper , the bad ass girl , who are these actors \? \? \? 
never heard of any of them except cole who was totally unbelievable in the part 
every time he opened his mouth you expect to hear , you see kids pulling the plug was a mercy killing for this horrible show 
the stories were as unbelievable as the actors 
lame would be the best way to describe it 
im big fan of rpg games too , but this movie , its a disgrace to any self respecting rpger there is 
the lines , the cuts , the audio , everything is wrong 
you can find better movies at youtube 
top line do n't waste your time and money on this one , its as bad as it comes 
a lassie movie which should have been put to sleep forever 
that 's how i 'd describe this painfully dreary time waster of a film 
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull , uninteresting mess , this is one of the most forgettable movies i 've seen 
it is n't even an achievement as a so bad it 's good or so bad it 's memorable movie 
it 's an empty , hollow shell of a movie 
seriously , it 's not worth wasting your , or your kid 's time on 
avoid , avoid , avoid ! 
it will drive you barking mad ! 
nothing new there 
that was done in the second movie 
the movie has almost no action scenes in it and very little comedy 
the plot has more holes than a pair of fishnet stockings and the direction and editing is astonishingly ham fisted 
what on earth is irons doing in this film \? 
the football scenes at the end were perplexing 
this scene is very strong and unpleasant 
and it was boring 
i am so tired of clich s that is just lazy writing , and here they come in thick and fast 
why was this film made \? 
the film has an ultra cheap look to it 
the result is a film that just do n't look right 
none of them are engaging or exciting 
the plot is nonsense that does n't interest in the slightest way or have any uniqueness to it 
the foreigner is not worth one second of your time 
how this piece of trash was ever released is beyond me the acting , the story , the characters , the supposedly special effects , etc it 's all wrong 
in fact , this stinker smells like a direct to video release 
avoid at all costs ! 
star trek v the final frontier is the worst in the series 
the acting from all involved and that includes those like shatner and nimoy is bad and washed out and making them seem as old as they look in real life , the special effects are tacky like when spock has to rescue kirk on a jet pack when he falls down from a mountain 
the only place good for this film is in the garbage 
the worst one of the series 
very disappointed and wondered how it could be in the oscar shortlist 
it 's very slow 
lot of holes in the plot there 's nothing about how he became the emperor nothing about where he spend 20 years between his childhood and mature age 
\) do n't waste your time 
end of days is one of the worst big budget action movies i 've ever seen 
he surely does n't know how to make a coherent action movie from the screenwriter of air force one who was only obliged to write the script just for a big sum of money 
this was one of the worst films i have ever seen 
i'm still trying to get over how bad it was 
1 hour 54 minutes of sheer tedium , melodrama and horrible acting , a mess of a script , and a sinking feeling of good lord , what were they thinking \? 
lots of holes in the script 
it 's like a bad two hour tv movie 
now imagine that every single one of those decisions was made wrong 
the dialogue is atrocious 
the acting is beyond abysmal 
everything stinks 
trouble is , the writing and directing make it impossible to establish those things that make a movie watchable , like character , story , theme and so on 
worse , there 's an incredibly weak sub plot thrown in that follows a little band of latter day mansonites as they go after a reporter who 's working on a story on the anniversary of the killings 
it 's dumb and pointless , and a complete waste of time 
in short , do n't bother with this movie 
also the story and acting were weak 
at around 4 pm i bought it , at around 8pm i started to watch , at around 8 15pm i fast forwarded the remaining film to see if there was anything left watchable for a human being with a brain but there was n't 
either way , it sucks 
the script is horrendously stupid 
the story starts too fast with absolutely no suspense or build up in the slightest 
everything captain howdy says is either laughable or just plain stupid 
what the hell kind of crap is that \? ! 
then , there 's the plot holes 
you could drive a semi truck into these holes ! 
dee snider just plain sucks 
he ca n't act \( one of the least scary villains i have ever seen \) , he ca n't write \( did he write this damn movie in his sleep \? 
i was bored throughout the whole damn thing 
the acting sucks , the music sucks , the script sucks , the pacing sucks , the special fx suck , the directing sucks basically , this movie sucks 
this film tries to be a serious and sophisticated thriller horror flick and it fails miserably 
this is probably one of the least effective and utterly unoriginal films i have ever seen in my entire life 
a piece of cinematic garbage captured on celluloid 
avoid at any and all costs 
at any rate this film stinks , its not funny , and fulci should have stayed with giallo and supernatural zombie movies 
avoid this film at all costs 
i do n't know what happened in season five , what a mess 
the only consistent thread holding the series together were the amazing performances of leni parker and anita laselva as the two taelons in quiet idealogical conflict 
now this is a movie i really dislike 
it 's one of the most boring horror movies from the 90 's mainly because it starts slow and centers in a boring atmosphere 
the puppets look really cheesy , not in a good way like in the puppet master 80 's flicks 
the story is lame , not interesting and never really explains the sinister origins of the puppets 
there are n't death scenes like in previous movies and the f x are terrible 
i felt asleep the first time i watched it , so i can recommend it for insomniacs 
otherwise , do n't even waste your time on this 
this one just fails to create any real suspense 
as for the killer , do n't expect anything original or even remotely frightening 
i'm so sorry but i really ca n't recommend it to anyone 
one of the most boring , pointless movies i have ever seen 
the secondary plot line is incomprehensible and its relation to the primary plot line is mystifying 
hated it 
this is one of the worst sandra bullock movie since speed 2 but not quite that bad 
i do n't understand how this garbage got on the shelves of the movie store , it 's not even a real movie ! 
i highly doubt that anyone could ever like this trash 
this is not movie making 
the acting is like watching wooden puppets moving around and reading from a book , that 's how bad it is 
so i am here to warn you do not rent this movie , it is the dumbest thing you have never seen ! 
i agree with jessica , this movie is pretty bad 
characters are one dimensional , even the good guys and especially the bad guys 
the story line is totally predictable 
i 've seen soap operas more intelligent than this movie 
bad characters , bad story and bad acting 
really awful 
not easy to watch 
just whatever you do , avoid groove as its the antithesis of all that is good about human traffic 
it 's too bad that everyone else involved did n't share crowe 's level of dedication to quality , for if they did , we 'd have a far better film on our hands than this sub par mess 
the movie seemed a little slow at first 
if you act in such a film , you should be glad that you 're gonna drift away from earth as far as possible ! 
this one wants to surf on the small wave of space movies in 1998 \( deep impact and armageddon \) , and this one fails everywhere 
if you have n't choked in your own vomit by the end \( by all the cheap drama and worthless dialogue \) you 've must have bored yourself to death with this waste of time 
instead , we got a bore fest about a whiny , spoiled brat babysitting 
i never walked out of a movie faster 
i just got bored watching jessice lange take her clothes off ! 
unfortunately , any virtue in this film 's production work was lost on a regrettable script 
in a word , it is embarrassing 
exceptionally bad ! 
all in all its an insult to one 's intelligence and a huge waste of money
