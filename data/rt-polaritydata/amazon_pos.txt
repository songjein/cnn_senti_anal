i love this thing!	
everything about it is fine and reasonable for the price i.e.

this phone is slim and light and the display is beautiful.	
its a little geeky but i think thats its sex on toast and it rocks and oozes sex right down to its battery embedded sleek stylish leather case.

absolutely great.	
the keyboard is a nice compromise between a full qwerty and the basic cell phone number keypad.	
it is very comfortable on the ear.	
it has been a winner for us.	
)setup couldn't have been simpler.

my headset works just peachy-keen.	
voice recognition is tremendous!	
i got this phone on reccomendation from a relative and i'm glad i did.	
i had absolutely no problem with this headset linking to my 8530 blackberry curve!	
i know that sounds funny, but to me it seemed like sketchy technology that wouldn't work well.well, this one works great.	
this phone is very fast with sending any kind of messages and web browsing is significantly faster than previous phones i have used.	
nice quality build, unlike some cheap s*** out there.

all in all i think it was a good investment.	
the best electronics of the available fm transmitters.

the "1.2" mega pixel camera, being a part of a phone, is reasonably good7.	
i've had this for nearly 2 years and it has worked great for me.

great phone.	
excellent phone.	
the voice recognition thru the handset is excellent.	
this is hands down the best phone i've ever had.	
works great, when my cat attacked the phone he scratched the protective strip instead of destroying the screen.	
this one works and was priced right.	
now i know that i made a wise decision.	
someone shouldve invented this sooner.	
good price.	
everything worked on the first try.the device was certainly engineered in a clever way and the construction feels good.	
i received it quickly and it works great!!	
has been working great.	
this is a good battery, and it got here really fast.	
also its slim enough to fit into my alarm clock docking station without removing the case.	
phone now holds charge like it did when it was new.	
we have gotten a lot of compliments on it.	
this is definitely a must have if your state does not allow cell phone usage while driving.	
i love this device.	
i am also very happy with the price.	
i was able to do voice dialing in the car with no problem.	
good item, low price.	
very comfortable.	
the battery is working well as a replacement for the original that came with the phone over 2 years ago.	
the reception is excellent!	
it fits comfortably in either ear, the sound is clear and loud, and the charge lasts a couple of days.	
very clear, quality sound and you don't have to mess with the sound on your ipod since you have the sound buttons on the headset.	
excellent sound quality.	
new battery works great in phone.	
i've dropped my phone more times than i can say, even on concrete and my phone is still great (knock on wood!).	
good audio quality.	
this little device has transformed my organizational capability and made my life a whole lot easier.	
works like a charm.. works as advertised.	
comfortable, nice range, good battery life.	
the microphone also works well, but (according to people i have called) it applifies everything.	
nice design and quality.	
it is light, easy to use, and has very clear reception and transmission.	
it definitely was not as good as my s11.	
awesome device.	
i had ordered a motorola data cable, got a very well finished and working product.

clear skype calls, long battery life, long range.

i have used several phone in two years, but this one is the best.	
an awesome new look for fall 2000!.	
price is good too.	
i'm using it with an iriver spinn (with case) and it fits fine.	
overall, i am psyched to have a phone which has all my appointments and contacts in and gets great reception.	
every thing on phone work perfectly, she like it.	
it's really easy.	
my sanyo has survived dozens of drops on blacktop without ill effect.	
fantastic earphones.	
it finds my cell phone right away when i enter the car.	
i highly recommend this modest priced cellular phone.	
but it does get better reception and clarity than any phone i've had before.	
awsome device works great!!.	
restored my phone to like new performance.	
i would recommend purchasing the jabra jx-10 series 2 which works flawlessly with my moto q, go figure.	
i searched the internet, and found this one to be the best value.	
very happy with this product.	
the screen size is big, key pad lit well enough, and the camera quality is excellent for a camera phone.	
i'm glad i found this product on amazon it is hard to find, it wasn't high priced.	
portable and it works.	
my colleague & i now get great reception.a little expensive, but performance is great.	
timely shipment and quality product.	
nice solid keyboard.	
very well made and fits my surefire gx2 perfectly.	
we would recommend these to others.	
the battery works great!	
looks great and is strong."	
i have had tmobile service for 2 or 3 years now, and i am pretty happy with it.	
great software for motorolas.	
the delivery was on time.	
very easy to use.	
it holds a charge for a long time, is reasonably comfortable under long-wearing conditions and the quality of sound is tremendous.	
the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i don't expect any problems.	
after charging overnight, these batteries work great.	
you won't regret it!	
i love this phone!.	
this pda rocks.	
it is super charged up for use as a small hybrid palmtop/camera/cellphone, and excels in those roles.	
i would definitely recommend the jabra bt250v for those who are looking for comfort, clarity and a great price!	
i had verizon 2 years ago and really liked their service.	
works as described.	
well im satisfied.	
the bose noise cancelling is amazing, which is very important for a nyc commuter.	
this battery is an excellent bargain!	
i wear glasses and it fits fine with them.	
great...no problems at all!.	
this frog phone charm is adorable and very eye catching.	
the sound is clear and the people i talk to on it are amazed at the quality too.	
i got the aluminum case for my new palm vx and it worked really well--it has protected my handheld perfectly so far.	
very good product, well made.	
mobile phone tools are a must have.	
i am very impressed with the job that motorola did on the sturdiness of this phone.	
i received my orders well within the shipping timeframe, everything was in good working order and overall, i am very excited to have this source.	
the phone is sturdy and waterproof.	
thanks again to amazon for having the things i need for a good price!	
i ended up sliding it on the edge of my pants or back pockets instead.	
i had to go to a store and bought a new nokia phone which is working great.	
works great!.	
the noise shield is incrediable.	
razr battery - good buy.	
keep up the good work amazon!!	
great case and price!	
bluetooth range is good - a few days ago i left my phone in the trunk, got a call, and carried the conversation without a hitch.	
small, sleek, impressive looking, practical setup with ample storage in place.	
the eargels channel the sound directly into your ear and seem to increase the sound volume and clarity.	
i am glad i purchased it.	
no shifting, no bubbling, no peeling, not even a scratch, nothing!i couldn't be more happier with my new one for the droid.	
i own a jabra earset and was very happy with it, but the sound quality, especially outgoing, on this is better.	
i love the camera, it's really pretty good quality.	
thank you for such great service.	
its a total package.	
the seller is very understanding and patient, i would definitely buy from them again.	
great product for the price!.	
i have purchased these for both family and friends, and all enjoy their clarity and ease of use	
virgin wireless rocks and so does this cheap little phone!	
all in all, i'm quite satisfied with this purchase.	
great it was new packaged nice works good, no problems and it came in less time then i expected!!!!	
great product.	
this fixes all the problems.	
i am very happy	
i've had no trouble accessing the internet, downloading ringtones or performing any of the functions.	
it does everything the description said it would.	
it works great with a car charger, especially if you cannot plug in two adapters at the same time.	
it plays louder than any other speaker of this size; the price is so low that most would think the quality is lacking, however, it's not.	
better than expected.	
battery is holding up well.	
linked to my phone without effort.	
they are so cool!	
easy to use.	
better than new.	
a pretty good product.	
this is a great phone!.	
for the price on amazon, it is an excellent product, which i would highly recommend.	
their research and development division obviously knows what they're doing.	
those phones are working just fine now.	
i am more than happy with this product.	
overall, i would recommend this phone over the new walkman.	
it fits my ear well and is comfortable on.	
clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cent's up-and-coming.	
i like design and look of jabra behing the ear headsets and 5020 is pretty comfortible to wear 24 hours a day without pain in the ear.	
i was amazed at the quick arrival of the two original lg cell phone batteries and and at a fraction of the price.	
worked very well paired with a treo 700w and as a skype headset on my pc (using a usb bluetooth transceiver).	
this is a great product..... sure beats using your fingers!.	
all the other cases i've tried normally fall apart after a few months but this one seems to be in for the long haul.	
i recommend igo to anyone with different brand cell phones/mp3 players in the family.	
i posted more detailed comments under the grey or black phone, but i have the fire red and it's a great color!	
i did not have any problem with this item and would order it again if needed.	
not only did the software do a great job of this, i could also make my own ringtones form my existing cds without an internet connection.	
im surprised this is a good quality car charger and there's not much reviews about it.	
these are fabulous!	
i used bitpim (a free program you can find on the internet)to transfer data to the phone.the price of the cable was excellent.	
very wind-resistant.	
they do not last forever, but is not overly expensive to replace.easy to operate and the sound is much better than others i have tried.	
phone is sturdy as all nokia bar phones are.	
great phone.	
i'm pleased.	
i found the product to be easy to set up and use.	
no ear loop needed, it's tiny and the sound is great.	
the handsfree part works fine, but then the car tries to download the address book, and the treo reboots.overall, i still rate this device high.	
i'm happy about this purchase- good quality and low price.	
i love the look and feel of samsung flipphones.	
its well-designed and very sharp -- the blue is a very nice color.	
does everything it should and more.	
nice sound.	
much less than the jawbone i was going to replace it with.	
setup went very smoothly.	
it is well made, easy to access the phone and has a handy, detachable belt clip.	
it works fine on my motorola 325 cellphone, and a lot better than the worn-out battery did.	
the volume for the ringer is real good (you have choices how loud).	
i love the ringtones because they are so upbeat!	
easy to pair with my samsung cell.	
works well.	
clear crisp sound.	
i have to use the smallest earpieces provided, but it stays on pretty well.	
the phone can also take great pictures and even video clips.	
because both ears are occupied, background is not distracting at all.	
comfortable fit - you need your headset to be comfortable for at least an hour at a time, if not for an entire day.	
you can't beat the price on these.	
* comes with a strong light that you can use to light up your camera shots, and even flash sos signals (seriously!	
lightweight and works well.	
i love this cable - it allows me to connect any mini-usb device to my pc.	
this is cool because most cases are just open there allowing the screen to get all scratched up.	
appears to actually outperform the original battery from china that came with my v325i.	
jabra ear gels "r" the best!.	
it quit working after i'd used it for about 18 months, so i just purchased another one because this is the best headset i've ever owned.	
it was a great phone.	
good value, works fine - power via usb, car, or wall outlet.	
my phone doesn't slide around my car now and the grip prevents my phone from slipping out of my hand.	
this is simply the best bluetooth headset for sound quality!	
in the span of an hour, i had two people exclaim "whoa - is that the new phone on tv?!?	
i have always used corded headsets and the freedom from the wireless is very helpful.	
this case has passed the one year mark and while it shows signs of wear, it is 100% functional.	
other than that, the leather is nice and soft; the fit is very tight; the cut out for the face is a good shape.	
it has everything i need and i couldn't ask for more.	
this product is great... it makes working a lot easier i can go to the copier while waiting on hold for something.	
t-mobile has the best customer service anywhere.	
arrived quickly and much less expensive than others being sold.	
provides good protection and looks classy, too.	
krussel always good.	
the tracfonewebsite is user friendly and makes it easy toactivate, etc.	
the design is very good.4.	
i great reception all the time.	
i would highly recommend this product.	
fantastic buy and will get again for whatever my next phone is	
this blueant supertooth hands-free phone speaker is awesome.	
.... item arrived quickly and works great with my metro pcs samsung sch-r450 slider phone and sony premium sound in ear plugs.	
it is light, has plenty of battery capacity, and is very confortable to wear for somewhat extended periods of time.	
blue ant is easy to use.	
cheap but hey it works.. was pleasantly suprised given the low cost of this item.	
it's very convenient and simple to use - gets job done & makes the car ride so much smoother.	
the sound quality is excellent as well.	
its the best headset i have used.	
they have been around for years and carries the highest quality of anti-glare screen protector that i have found to date.	
just what i wanted.	
great product.	
crisp and clear.	
the reception has been generally good.	
excellent sound, battery life and inconspicuous to boot!.	
great bluetooth!.	
i highly recommend this case.	
worthwhile.	
this is a great deal.	
it is simple to use and i like it.	
it's a great tool for entertainment, communication, and data management.oh, be sure to use activesync 4.2 for optimal data synchronization results!	
i own 2 of these cases and would order another.	
great phone.	
i bought this battery with a coupon from amazon and i'm very happy with my purchase.	
perfect for the ps3.	
five star plus, plus.	
a good quality bargain.. i bought this after i bought a cheapy from big lots that sounded awful and people on the other end couldn't hear me.	
good , works fine.	
for the price this was a great deal.	
great price, too!	
yes it's shiny on front side - and i love it!	
the reception through this headset is excellent.	
2 thumbs up to this seller	
i have a verizon lg phone and they work well together, good reception and range that exceeds 20 feet line of sight.	
#1 it works - #2 it is comfortable.	
battery charge-life is quite long.	
the jabra eargels fit my ears very well.	
product is exactly as described.	
gets a signal when other verizon phones won't.	
i would recommend it.	
plan on ordering from them again and again.	
that being said, for a phone, the camera is very nice; many cool effects to play with, and video is decent as well.	
i have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one.	
they keep getting better and better (this is my third one and i've had numerous palms too).	
the shipping time was also very quick!	
good case!.	
really good product.	
it looks very nice.	
this is an excellent tool, especially when paired with your phone's auto-answer.	
i have read other's reviews here but i haven't had any problem with it.	
comfortable in my hand.	
(it works!)	
so far it has worked like a charm.	
i have only had it for a few weeks, but so far, so good.	
but, in any case, the best part is, you can download these pictures to your laptop using ir, or even send pictures from your laptop to the phone.	
would recommend this item.	
it's been my choice headset for years.great sound; good volume; good noise cancellation.	
nice case, feels good in your hands.	
just really good.. so far, probably the best bt headset i have ever had.	
works fine.	
i received my headset in good time and was happy with it.	
i was very pleased to see that i could replace my well travled swivel holster for my blackberry flip.	
my sister has one also and she loves it.	
good quality.	
excellent dual-purpose headset.	
excellent!.	
it seems completely secure, both holding on to my belt, and keeping the iphone inside.	
the only good thing was that it fits comfortably on small ears.	
i am pairing this with my iphone, and i could not be happier with it so far.	
best headset ever!!!.	
it was that loud.glad to say that the plantronics 510 maintains a flawless connection to my cell and with no static during normal use.	
fits comfortably, came with three sizes of earbud tips.	
excellent product for the price.	
it was quite comfortable in the ear.	
great phone.	
the pairing of the two devices was so easy it barely took a couple minutes before i started making calls with the voice dialing feature.	
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly.	
i love being able to use one headset for both by land-line and cell.	
but despite these few flaws, this case is of exceptional quality and well worth the additional costs of owning an official oem product.	
i can hear while i'm driving in the car, and usually don't even have to put it on it's loudest setting.	
seller shipped quickly and much cheaper than the competitors.	
good show, samsung.	
so i bought about 10 of these and saved alot of money.	
leopard print is wonderfully wild!.	
works for me.	
much better than the hard plastic cases.	
happy so far!.	
cool phone.	
works good.	
motorola finally got the voice quality of a bluetooth headset right.	
but it is great, i would really recommend it	
you get extra minutes so that you can carry out the call and not get cut off."	
the headset fulfills my requirements so i am happy with my purchase.	
logitech bluetooth headset is a 10!.	
i like the fact that it rests lightly against your ear, rather than inside.	
a lot of websites have been rating this a very good phone and so do i.	
i have tried these cables with my computer and my ipod and it works just fine.	
it is easy to turn on and off when you are in the car and the volume controls are quite accessable.	
i have had mine for about a year and this christmas i bought some for the rest of the family.	
otherwise, easy to install and use, clear sound.	
nice leather.	
it is a joy to use.	
very satisifed with that.	
this is the phone to get for 2005.... i just bought my s710a and all i can say is wow!	
just reading on the specs alone makes you say wow.	
love it.. great armband.	
i really like this product over the motorola because it is allot clearer on the ear piece and the mic.	
i exchanged the sony ericson z500a for this and i'm pretty happy with that decision.	
i was very impressed with the price of the cases.	
also makes it easier to hold on to.	
i use this product in a motor control center where there is a lot of high voltage humming from the equipment, and it works great!	
it's pretty easy.	
beautiful styling though.	
excellent product.	
it is the best charger i have seen on the market yet.	
sweetest phone!!!	
:-)oh, the charger seems to work fine.	
it fits so securely that the ear hook does not even need to be used and the sound is better directed through your ear canal.	
don't know about v170/
