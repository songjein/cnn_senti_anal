the best scene in the movie was when gerardo is trying to find a song that keeps running through his head 
saw the movie today and thought it was a good effort , good messages for kids 
loved the casting of jimmy buffet as the science teacher 
and those baby owls were adorable 
the movie showed a lot of florida at it 's best , made it look very appealing 
the songs were the best and the muppets were so hilarious 
it was so cool 
this is a very right on case movie that delivers everything almost right in your face 
this review is long overdue , since i consider a tale of two sisters to be the single greatest film ever made 
i 'll put this gem up against any movie in terms of screenplay , cinematography , acting , post production , editing , directing , or any other aspect of film making 
it 's practically perfect in all of them a true masterpiece in a sea of faux masterpieces 
the structure of this film is easily the most tightly constructed in the history of cinema 
i can think of no other film where something vitally important occurs every other minute 
in other words , the content level of this film is enough to easily fill a dozen other films 
how can anyone in their right mind ask for anything more from a movie than this \? 
it 's quite simply the highest , most superlative form of cinema imaginable 
yes , this film does require a rather significant amount of puzzle solving , but the pieces fit together to create a beautiful picture 
this is the number one best th game in the series 
it deserves strong love 
it is an insane game 
there are massive levels , massive unlockable characters it 's just a massive game 
waste your money on this game 
this is the kind of money that is wasted properly 
actually , the graphics were good at the time 
as they say in canada , this is the fun game , aye 
this game rocks 
buy it , play it , enjoy it , love it 
it 's pure brilliance 
the film succeeds despite , or perhaps because of , an obviously meagre budget 
i'm glad the film did n't go for the most obvious choice , as a lesser film certainly would have 
in addition to having one of the most lovely songs ever written , french cancan also boasts one of the cutest leading ladies ever to grace the screen 
it 's hard not to fall head over heels in love with that girl 
excellent cast , story line , performances 
totally believable 
anne heche was utterly convincing 
sam shepard 's portrayal of a gung ho marine was sobering 
i sat riveted to the tv screen 
all in all i give this one a resounding 9 out of 10 
i do think tom hanks is a good actor 
i enjoyed reading this book to my children when they were little 
there are some generally great things in it 
the suspense builders were good , just cross the line from g to pg 
i especially liked the non cliche choices with the parents in other movies , i could predict the dialog verbatim , but the writing in this movie made better selections 
if you want a movie that 's not gross but gives you some chills , this is a great choice 
alexander nevsky is a great film 
he is an amazing film artist , one of the most important whoever lived 
this if the first movie i 've given a 10 to in years 
if there was ever a movie that needed word of mouth to promote , this is it 
overall , the film is interesting and thought provoking 
plus , it was well paced and suited its relatively short run time 
give this one a look 
i gave it a 10 
the wind and the lion is well written and superbly acted 
it is a true classic 
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as b list horror suspense films go 
definitely worth checking out 
manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 
the scenes are often funny and occasionally touching as the characters evaluate their lives and where they are going 
the cast of veteran actors are more than just a nostalgia trip 
ursula burton 's portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church 
if you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast , some good music \( including a shirley jones rendition of the way you look tonight \) , and an uplifting ending , give this one a try 
i do n't think you will be disappointed 
the only thing really worth watching was the scenery and the house , because it is beautiful 
but in terms of the writing it 's very fresh and bold 
the acting helps the writing along very well \( maybe the idiot savant sister could have been played better \) , and it is a real joy to watch 
some applause should be given to the prelude however 
i really liked that 
a great film by a great director 
the movie had you on the edge of your seat and made you somewhat afraid to go to your car at the end of the night 
the music in the film is really nice too 
i 'd advise anyone to go and see it 
brilliant ! 
10 10 
i liked this movie way too much 
it rocked my world and is certainly a must see for anyone with no social or physical outlets 
this is definitely a cult classic well worth viewing and sharing with others 
also , it 's a real treat to see anthony quinn playing crazy horse 
still , i do like this movie for it 's empowerment of women there 's not enough movies out there like this one 
an excellent performance from ms 
garbo , who showed right off the bat that her talents could carry over from the silent era \( i wanted to see some of her silent work , but netflix does n't seem to be stocking them 
it 's also great to see that renowned silent screenwriter frances marion has n't missed a step going from silent to sound 
you 'll love it ! 
the movie i received was a great quality film for it 's age 
john wayne did an incredible job for being so young in the movie industry 
his on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him 
i think that it is a must see older john wayne film 
jamie foxx absolutely is ray charles 
his performance is simply genius 
he owns the film , just as spacek owned coal miner 's daughter and quaid owned great balls of fire 
in fact , it 's hard to remember that the part of ray charles is being acted , and not played by the man himself 
ray charles is legendary 
ray charles' life provided excellent biographical material for the film , which goes well beyond being just another movie about a musician 
hitchcock is a great director 
secondly , hitchcock pretty much perfected the thriller and chase movie 
when i first watched this movie , in the 80s , i loved it 
i was totally fascinated by the music , the dancing everything 
if good intentions made a film great , then this film might be one of the greatest films ever made 
the film has great actors , a master director , a significant theme at least a would be significant theme , undertone of fifties existential world weariness , aerial scenes that ought to have thrilled both senses and imagination , and characters about which one might deeply care 
yet , i enjoy watching it 
that was nice 
that was funny 
it was so funny 
spoilers whatever else can \( or ca n't \) be said about it , surface is superbly crafted 
the cinematography is simply stunning \( to say the least \) and the fx are nothing if not state of the art 
conceptually , the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody \( parents , kids , fantasy and or fx fans \) 
and there was n't a single sour note struck acting wise , either some surprisingly solid casting , here 
all things considered , a job very well done 
thanks good a movie like this was done and released 
one of the best mexican movies ever ! , and one of the less understood , even by mexican themselves , no matter how identified the should have felt with it 
it ranks highly as a great noir crime drama , incredible performances by belmondo and lino ventura 
the attention given to every character , and complex psychological portrayals , detailing loyalty , treachery , love , and hope , are tremendous 
it is an excellent drama , an excellent thriller , and an excellent film 
up there with the best of melville 
everything about this film is simply incredible 
you truly take this journey through the eyes and soul of a child 
black water is a thriller that manages to completely transcend it 's limitations \( it 's an indie flick \) by continually subverting expectations to emerge as an intense experience 
the performances are real and gripping , the crocdodile is extremely well done , indeed if the black water website is to be believed that 's because they used real crocs and the swamp location is fabulous 
i thoroughly enjoyed it when christopher eccleston took control of the tardis and the continuation of the series 
there is a lot of beautiful places 
an amazing finale to possibly the best trilogy of all time ! 
kieslowski never ceases to amaze me 
he is one of my favourite directors , and one of the most talented directors in the history of cinema 
his use of the colours of the french flag in the three films was nothing short of incredible , every shot , every scene was like a work of art 
three of the most visually appealing movies i 've ever seen 
and his subtle connections between the three films are awesome 
i could n't think of a better way to end the film , but a smile on my face , great way to wrap up an amazing film and trilogy ! 
i recommend this for everyone who loves film , movies , anything a work of art ! 
10 out of 10 for both the movie and trilogy 
i think i was one of the people who found this another one of roth 's pearls 
his performance , as awarded , was stunning 
the story which was told so eloquently by francis ford coppola 25 years earlier , really unfolds gradually and leaves room for the characters to develop 
in a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast 
all in all a beautiful directed film from nicola 's roeg wih a sublime cast 
this is such a fun and funny movie 
highly entertaining at all angles 
it features an outlandish array of memorable , psychotic but lovable nuts 
so for our enjoyment we get to see them run around , play games , and be dangerous 
it even has its sweet moments 
the telephone repair man was really funny and his reactions to the nuts and bitchy boss were truly genuine 
all the characters in this film are tremendously well played 
and i really did find them funny 
this is actually a very smart movie 
there is a brilliant twist ending 
i love it 
the ending is so , so perfect you 'll shed a tear 
i am so thrilled after seeing a movie like this 
i will never forget it now 
it is not just a cult it is a cult classic 
it is a really good show to watch 
it is very educational for children 1 to 8 years old 
barney is definitely super de duper 
is pretty funny 
babie bop is very cute 
the kids are very cool too 
i would give this television series a 10 plus if i could 
the writers were smack on and i think the best actors and actresses were a bonus to the show these characters were so real 
i must say i have taped most of the episodes and i find myself watching them over and over again 
now you know why i gave it a 10 ! 
i do n't know exactly what it is about this movie , but we latched on to this endearing movie and it has become a special part of our family 's memories 
i totally and absolutely recommend this movie to anyone who likes good wholesome family movies because that is exactly what this is 
the things that the four kids get themselves into is absolutely hilarious to watch 
this is one of the best movies out there that shows such strong sibling bond for each other 
much more interesting , more action , more suspense , and less of the unneeded controversy 
everything from acting to cinematography was solid 
definitely worth checking out 
damian is so talented and versatile in so many ways of writing and portraying different characters on screen 
this movie has a cutting edge to it 
i am so pleased to know such a modern day genius is out there , letting is passion for art drive him and taking us as an audience with him 
elias koteas , jack palance play good roles angelina is hot and gets naked billy drago appears in this and is cool as usual a cameo by sven ole thorsen helps make this a very enjoyable movie with good acting and a decent budget 
this was such an awesome movie that i bought it off of ebay 
i really loved the story line and the poler bear was kinda cute but if anyone has a question about fort steele , just ask away \) 
i think the most wonderful parts \( literally , full of wonder \) are the excerpts from his works 
the sets \( especially designed to work with the camera \) are amazing stylized , beautiful and effective 
they could be used as exemplars for any set designer 
the stories were powerful explorations of the nature of man and of art 
after watching this film , i wanted to learn more about the works of this artist 
i highly recommend this movie for anyone interested in art , poetry , theater , politics , or japanese history 
here , in the wind and the lion , we see a wonderful rendering of america 's own imperial age 
\) what makes this story different are the terrific production values faultless photography , composition and editing the terrific casting the underappreciated brian keith playing a bully teddy and vivid history 
this is high adventure at its best 
i think it was robert ryans best film , because he portrayed someone like my father , and he was a schizophrenic in real life , \( my father \) although he never murdered anyone but was affected more so during the second world war which made him worse 
having to humour him just to get by and get through the day was so apt 
\( my mother and brother had to do this \) when i saw robert ryan portraying this type of man , it was a very good imitation of this type of individual , and i was impressed 
non linear narration thus many flashbacks and every part are articulated quite well 
the good cinematography also makes her and monica bellucci look very beautiful 
a good commentary of today 's love and undoubtedly a film worth seeing 
for people who are first timers in film making , i think they did an excellent job ! ! 
it was very popular when i was in the cinema , a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs 
it 's a feel good film and that 's how i felt when i came out of the cinema ! 
it has northern humour and positive about the community it represents 
i rather enjoyed it 
i liked it 
it really created a unique feeling though 
vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script 
a world better than 95 of the garbage in the theatres today 
her role was played well 
not too screamy not to masculine but just right 
the camera really likes her in this movie 
i would have casted her in that role after ready the script 
as a european , the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980 's and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities , although the circumstances were slightly different 
i just cant explain this movie more than romantic , charming , hilarious , and adorable the junkyard scenes are funny , all the junkyard dogs have something special too funny i laughed , kids will love it buy it when it comes out , it has new features ! 
an interesting premise , and billy drago is always good as a dangerous nut bag \( side note i 'd love to see drago , stephen mchattie and lance hendrikson in a flick together talk about raging cheekbones ! \) 
the soundtrack was n't terrible , either 
still , it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oy vey scale 
both do good jobs and are quite amusing 
the last 15 minutes of movie are also not bad as well 
i like armand assante my cable company 's summary sounded interesting , so i watched it , twice already , and probably will again 
i believe the screenwriter did a good job of tying up the loose ends 
my 8 10 score is mostly for the plot 
i wo n't say any more i do n't like spoilers , so i do n't want to be one , but i believe this film is worth your time 
i was deeply impressed with the character he played 
i knew when i saw the film that more great things were to come from this gifted actor 
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had it 's share of ups and down , but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other 
i have seen many movies starring jaclyn smith , but my god this was one of her best , though it came out 12 years ago 
this movie contained an all star cast , and what i loved the most was that it opened my eyes to see other actors who i have n't seen before 
this movie was kind of long in length , but i enjoyed every minute of it 
overall i rate this movie a 10 out of a 1 10 scale 
lifetime does not air it enough , so if anyone knows what store sells it let me know because this is a must have 
totally different , with loads of understatement and black comedy , this is a film few get to see , but those who do will remember it 
this movie creates its own universe , and is fascinating in every way 
but this movie really got to me 
see it 
i really hope the team behind this movie makes more movies , and that they will continue to do so in their own , some kinda weird style 
and i forgot the casting here i superb , with trond fausa aurv g being perfect in the role as the bothersome man , who does n't understand where he is , what he is doing and why 
this movie is a good and humorous comment on life in 2006 
i found this move beautiful , enjoyable , and uplifting 
initially the local sites in the film , which was filmed here in buffalo , intrigued me 
later i found myself lost in the power of the film 
the entire audience applauded at the conclusion of the film 
i left the theater with a lilt in my step , joy in my heart and hope for the human race 
duris has a wholesome appearance and gives a fine performance 
the rest of the cast also play well 
cinematography noteworthy including fine views of barcelona and its famed gaudi towers 
the cast is good 
for that , it 's worth checking out 
the cast was great 
steve martin delivers a really funny performance of a middle aged , upper class , uptight white guy 
add betty white and jean smart and you have a great cast everyone played their parts really well 
steamboat willie is an amazingly important film to our cinema history 
this second appearance of mickey mouse \( following the silent plane crazy earlier that year \) is probably his most famous film mostly because it was so ground breaking 
while you do n't yet hear mickey speak , there are tons of sound effects and music throughout the film something we take for granted now but which was a huge crowd pleaser in 1928 
however , after seeing the short again after about 25 years , i was amazed at how timeless the film actually is 
it 's just adorable seeing mickey playing turkey in the straw in a highly imaginative \( if occasionally cruel \) way 
clever and a real crowd pleaser this film still ranks among mickey 's best films even after 80 wonderful years 
the original body and soul \( 1947 \) is a masterpiece 
john garfield , ann revere , lilli plmer , william conrad , canada lee and filmed by one of the greatest cinematographers to ever grace the screen james wong howe 
okay , i like to consider myself a fair critic , so i 'll give credit where credit 's due the creature effects were actually pretty cool 
gotta love those close ups of slimy , drooling teeth ! 
the film 's sole bright spot was jonah hill \( who will look almost unrecognizable to fans of the recent superbad due to the amount of weight he lost in the interim \) 
being a 90 's child , i truly enjoyed this show and i can proudly say that i enjoyed it big time and even more than the classical wb cartoons 
but tiny toons kept the 90 's vibe and delivered one of the most popular , funny , and underrated cartoons ever created 
the memories are murky but i can only say that i enjoyed every single episode and product related to the show 
easily , none other cartoon made me laugh in a tender way \( before getting into dark sitcoms oriented for teenagers \) 
the characters were all funny and had the peculiarity of not having a true lead character 
every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead 
perabo has a nice energy level and is obviously very comfortable in front of a camera 
i believe that pitch black was done well 
the characters are interesting and you want to find out more about them the longer the movie goes on , and i think people will be surprised by who does and does n't make it 
go watch it ! 
very funny ! 
the characters are interesting and you really care for them 
an instant classic , with a great soundtrack and a catchy song during the ending credits 
do n't miss it 
a mature , subtle script that suggests and occasionally brings into dramatic focus the underlying tensions is well served by perfect performances \( apart from the odd inappropriate smiling that keira knightley is prone to , though perhaps under direction this time as the other characters themselves often mention it \) 
but above all the exquisite visual composition of each moment , with inventive and elegant use of close up , camera angle and lighting , including pointillistic faux home movie footage , is a wonder and joy to behold 
it 's as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci , but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that master 's work 
i saw this film over christmas , and what a great film it was ! 
i thought errol flynn was brilliant as custer and has since become my favourite actor ! 
his acting alongside olivia de havilland was brilliant and the ending was fantastic ! 
i had always known that errol flynn was a brilliant actor as he was my dads favourite actor , and i grew up watching his films as a child 
but it was n't until i watched this film that i realised how great he actually was 
i 'll give this film 10 out of 10 ! 
lovely little thriller from hitchcock , with lots of nice shenanigans surrounding a murdered spy , a kidnapped child , a nasty church , a foreign plot and some random taxidermists 
jimmy stewart is as ever a great hero for hitchcock , the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function , but it lacks the brooding menace of hitchcock 's black and white , low budget original 
nevertheless yet another wonderful film from the great master 's stable 
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film ! 
excellently produced by one of sci fi 's best producers scot vandiver ! 
but it is entertaining , nonetheless 
it 's a campy sort of film that 's a joy to watch 
there 's barely a boring moment in the film and there are plenty of humorous parts 
the cast is always entertaining as usual 
overall , a delight ! 
this movie does an excellent job of revealing the complexity of the task and the incredible challenges facing south africa 
i believe every one should see this movie as i think few people outside of south africa understand its past and what is being attempted in the truth and reconciliation process 
nothing short of magnificent photography cinematography in this film 
the acting is fantastic , the stories are seamlessly woven together , and the dogs are splendid a must rent , view , or see 
do n't be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy 10 10 
excellent performance 
there still are good actors around ! 
also great directing and photography 
very true to shakespear , and a 'must' for all shakespear fans 
macbeth \( jason connery \) moved me to tears with his final monolog \( out brief candle , out \) he gave the sphere of moral decay and dark forces a human face , which makes it the more interesting 
helen baxendale is a very credible lady macbeth who can be very cheerfull at times and sometimes she just looks like a naughty girl , but deadly in her taste for blood and evil 
if you love death and decay , and shakespears lyrics this is the one 
this is a witty and delightful adaptation of the dr seuss book , brilliantly animated by upa 's finest and thoroughly deserving of its academy award 
special mention should be made of the superb music score and sound effects , which are an integral element in helping to make this such a memorable and enjoyable cartoon 
however paul schrader has indeed made a film about mishima that is both superb complex 
also notable is john bailey 's fine crisp beautifully colored cinematography and the great production design costumes by eiko ishioka who went on to do the memorable costumes for coppola 's dracula for which she received a well deserved oscar 
if you do watch it , however , there are small consolations the actresses playing anne 's sisters each do a wonderful job with their roles 
this is a stunning movie 
raw and sublimely moving 
it felt like a very gripping , intelligent stage play \( but without the overly theatrical feeling one actually gets from watching people on a stage \) which plays on everyone 's terror of a white lie escalating to monstrous consequences 
all of the main players are mesmerising 
tom wilkinson broke my heart at the end and everyone else 's judging by the amount of fumbling for hankies and hands going up to faces among males and females alike 
julian fellowes has triumphed again 
he 's a national treasure 
go and see it ! 
this is an excellent film 
the aerial scenes were well done 
it was also the right balance of war and love 
the film gives meaning to the phrase , never in the history of human conflict has so much been owed by so many to so few 
kris kristoffersen is good in this movie and really makes a difference 
a good film by a great director ! 
this is definitely one of the better documentaries i have seen looking at family relationships and marriage 
this is just a great movie 
10 out of 10 stars 
punishment park is a brilliant piece of cinema 
shot in the southern california desert using his patent faux documentary style , watkins creates a film like no other 
this is one of peter watkins most accessible films 
i advise you to look out for it 
you wont regret it ! 
highly recommended a 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is , in many ways , a modern equivalent of dickens' christmas carol in its sensibility 
the success of the film depends on the casting of sydney greenstreet as the alexander yardley character 
the attractive set used throughout most of the film is an eye pleasing gem 
the transfers are very good 
very nice and relaxing late night viewing 
the movie is full of wonderful dancing \( hence the title ! 
\) some great music , and terrific scenery 
it handles some tough issues with dignity and grace , and , of course , has \( shocking spoiler here ! 
\) a happy , wonderful , feel good ending ! 
the point is the journey , a journey that touches every member of the family 
it 's one of the movies i need to see whenever it comes on tv never mind the fact that i already have it memorized ! 
i just saw this film and i recommend it 
it has a very good plot , it holds your complete attention , the acting is superb , tom wilkinson was fantastic and emily watson was also very good 
a very good film indeed , about great and unconditional love 
tom wilkinson 's character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin , but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses , and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the character 's anguish and suffering 
emily watson 's character is very strong , and she has only to give a quick glance and you understand everything 
despite the pans of reviewers , i liked this movie 
in fact , i liked it better than interview with a vampire and i liked this lestat \( stuart townsend \) better than cruise 's attempt 
aailiyah was pretty good as akasha , in places compelling \( her first entrance and mini dance scene \) 
i'm a big fan of this series mostly due to anne rice 's style , sensitivities and treatments 
i guess i liked the details of his dysfunction he was believable 
but i thought his acting was skilled 
meredith m was better than all right 
a very charming film with wonderful sentiment and heart 
it is rare when a film maker takes the time to tell a worthy moral tale with care and love that does n't fall into the trap of being overly syrupy or over indulgent 
nine out of ten for a truly lovely film 
this early film from future goremeister lucio fulci is a very good addition to the giallo sub genre 
this is one of the best italian thrillers of the early 70 's 
a standout scene 
technically , the film is well made with impressive camera work , solid acting and effective music from riz ortolani particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like it 's coming from a distant hill 
it 's still wild stuff though and is highly recommended to fans of giallo cinema 
the movie was very interesting from beginning to the end 
i liked the way dustin hoffman 's character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son 
this movie is also revealing 
personally , i think it shows that people should learn to find a compromise them self without involving other people into issue 
ps the only scene in the movie that was cool is when the central character finds her room blown up 
it 's a fresh , subtle , and rather sublime effect 
an italian reviewer called this a small , great film , and that 's right 
all the actors give a wonderful performance , especially jennifer rubin as jamie harris , who changes from the nervous starlet in the beginning through the strange events she is part of to the cool star 
you learn a lot about the real inside emotions of people in this movie , and a lot about the movie business itself 
the movie in movie situations in the beginning and through the game that is played with her by the acting coach are fascinating 
also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score i 've ever heard 
you wo n't forget this movie ! 
i saw it as a child on tv back in 1973 , when it was the stranger and i loved it 
but the duet between the astronaut and his doctor at the beginning of the movie is a perfect exchange if one considers that this movie was made well into the cold war and the astronaut 's biggest fear is that he has crashed in the ussr 
this movie is so awesome ! 
i loved it , it was really scary 
i love the scream movies and all horror movies and this one ranks way up there 
if you want a real scare rent this one ! 
10 10 
this is an extraordinary film 
as a courtroom drama , it 's compelling , as an indictment on the american justice system , it 's frightening 
this film highlights the fundamental flaws of the legal process , that it 's not about discovering guilt or innocence , but rather , is about who presents better in court 
the film is well paced , understated and one of the best courtroom documentaries i 've seen 
this mostly routine fact based tv drama gets a boost from the fine performance by cole 
predictable , but not a bad watch 
it was clear that she had the range and ability to pull off this part 
she carries the movie well 
constantine gives everything the right intensity and seems to have a good understanding of the underlying psychological motivations 
it is wonderful and inspiring to watch , and i hope that it gets released again on to video or dvd 
editing the editing of this film was phenomenal in my opinion 
when a song could explain the emotions of the subjects better , such as when jay adams' unfortunate life was a subject of talk , the song old man by neil young was played , which evokes many emotions 
cinematography the film was shot in an interesting way 
of course the footage from the 70s was grainy , but that only enhanced the film 
this film offers many delights and surprises 
when achille and philippa beautifully sing a duet from don giovanni that perfectly describes their situation in the movie , you appreciate the subtle layers of this excellent film 
the story unfolds in 18th century jutland and the use of period music played on period instruments is just one more fine touch 
you share general loewenhielm 's exquisite joy in his partaking of the cailles en sarcophage even though you are just watching a movie but you do wish for just a small sample to savor 
but this understated film leaves a lasting impression 
the warmth it generates is in contrast to its austere backdrop 
you will leave the theater wanting to go out and dance under the stars 
the acting , as you 'd expect from this cast , is top notch 
the characters are fleshed out surprisingly well , particularly grimes and blake , and all the actors deliver their sharply scripted lines with just the right amount of deadpan tongue in cheek to make the dialogue both hilarious and realistic 
angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing , violin playing anatomist doctor quinn 
conclusion i loved it 
it 's a long time since i was so entertained by a movie 
i struggle to find anything bad to say about it 
mark my words , this is one of those cult films like evil dead 2 or phantasm that people will still be discovering and falling in love with 20 , 30 , 40 years down the line 
it 's pretty surprising that this wonderful film was made in 1949 , as hollywood generally had its collective heads in the sand concerning black and white issues at that time 
the film deserves strong kudos for taking this stand , for having exceptional acting from its mostly lesser known cast and for the super intelligent script that does n't insult the audience or take the easy way out when it comes to white racism 
plus , with the movie 's rather modest budget and fast running time , it does an amazing job ! 
juano hernandez \( an exceptional actor who played supporting roles in many films of the era \) is a proud black man who is accused of murdering a white man in the south 
trumbull on i love lucy \) 
see it with your kids if you have a chance it will open up some amazing dialog about how far race relations have come in the last 50 years 
see both films if you can 
it was that year , however , that reminded us that huston was still at the top of his game as evinced by his faithful adaptation of james joyce 's acclaimed novella the dead 
feelings , thoughts gabriel 's discomfort during the dance all these intangibles leap to life and come within the viewer 's grasp in huston 's portrayal 
this movie is possibly one of the most creative works of horror ever 
it has everything you could want suspense , drama , comedy , confusing subplots , native americans , brain eating if you 're looking for the be all , end all of brainsucking movies , look no further 
with great sound effects , and impressive special effects , i ca n't recommend this movie enough 
call me a nut , but i think this is one of the best movies ever 
great character actors telly savalas and peter boyle 
i wo n't spoil it , but the ending in pretty amazing 
the best scene in the movie is at the end , but i wo n't spoil it 
if there was ever an indication of a writer and a director 's ability to meld two highly volatile temperaments into a seamless union of creativity , then this is it ! 
the result is a powerhouse achievement , made more timely now perhaps because of our culture 's disturbing fascination with celebrity , and it 's distorted interpretations of fame 
a film not easily forgotten 
but , kevin spacey is an excellent , verbal tsunami as buddy ackerman and totally believable because he is a great actor 
the scripting of the subtle comedy is unmatched by any movie in recent years 
the characters are interesting , even if a bit predictable 
highly recommended for all ages , although the younger set will probably not appreciate some of the more subtle references , they will certainly appreciate one galley scene in particular ! 
great movie ! 
linda cardellini is the only thing good in this film 
she 's poised and amazing 
the fact is , this film is a wonderful , heartwarming tale about two people chasing their dreams 
the best part about nurse betty is it 's unpredictability 
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality , and along with the touching drama , and hilarious comedy , you can never tell what is going to happen next 
there is , however , some pretty good acting \( at least , for this type of film \) 
i saw this short film on hbo the other day and absolutely loved it 
i did n't realize how wonderful the short really is until the last two scenes 
excellent short film 
hopefully , the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast , or win us over with a whole new film 
not much dialogue , not much music , the whole film was shot as elaborately and aesthetically like a sculpture 
funny , clever , hip just like pray 's previous film , hype ! 
it was a long time that i did n't see a so charismatic actor on screen 
paolo sorrentino has written a wonderful story about loneliness and tony has built one of the most unforgettable characters seen in movies in recent years 
the movie is not completely perfect but 'titta di girolamo' will stay with you for a long time after the vision of the movie 
i rate this movie 9 10 
i do not know if this was emilio estevez 's directorial debut , but the pacing , the interplay and development of the characters as well as some clever camera work surrounding the character estevez plays all suggest a natural eye 
the interplay between martin and emilio contains the same wonderful chemistry we saw in wall street with martin and charlie 
kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism a variation on her character in at play in the fields of the lord 
for readers who have already seen one of miyazaki 's films he is still in top form and made another worthwhile experience 
it never condescends , all the characters have good genuine hearts and believable problems 
the two main characters may be two of the most believable children i ever saw put on screen 
they are so easy to love , but even more easy to identify with 
this movie is great especially if you enjoy visual arts 
the scenery that the two daughters paint and photograph are beautiful 
the story is also both funny and poignant at times 
people who like european films and art movies will like this movie 
this is truly an art movie it actually has a lot of art in it 
go rent it 
however , after finally watching this film , i realized that not only had i had a closed mind to the brilliance it depicts , i also found myself watching it over and over again 
it 's the one movie that never ceases to interest me , simply because it keeps me alert , as i try to attempt to decipher it 's meanings 
brilliance indeed 
but if you liked movies like the matrix \( and better yet , their sequels \) i think you 'll appreciate the thought provoking , mindblowing experience this film will give you 
think of the film being like a dream 
simply beautiful 
both rickman and stowe play their roles to the hilt in this tale of a childrens' book writer who maybe \? has written a subversive tract 
it 's a gloriously fun , fast paced and fairly accurate portrayal of the night of a raver 
it presents a idyllic yet serious portrayal of the ups and downs of the characters lives 
but it picked up speed and got right to the point 
it showed exactly how the government and the scientist argued for humanity and the reasons of the gadget 
i enjoyed it 
i have recommended it to friends 
i was particularly pleased with the acting ability of dwight schultz 
both actors truly understand and become their particular character , delivering a convincing , sincere performance 
their on screen chemistry , critical to the entire film , is genuine 
the film 's dialogue is natural , real to life 
the writer , gorman bechard , undoubtedly did his homework because all references are industry and character age appropriate 
the incredible soundtrack truly captures the essence of the film 
each track commands sentiment , actually contributing to the scenes and characters 
definitely worth seeing it 's the sort of thought provoking film that forces you to question your own threshold of loneliness 
hayao miyazaki 's latest and eighth film for studio ghibili , gake no ue no ponyo \( ponyo on the cliff by the sea \) is a wonderfully fun and imaginative look at childhood 
at a time when it seems that film animation has been dominated by disney pixar 's cgi masterpieces , it is both refreshing and comforting to know that miyazaki is still relying on traditional hand drawn animation to tell his charming and enchanting stories 
enough can not be said of the remarkable animation in this film 
the art style has the appearance of crayon pencil drawings and is wonderfully colorful and fanciful 
still , it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost 
just consider the excellent story , solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses 
then i watched it again two sundays ago \( march 20th , 2005 \) and i began to really enjoy it and this time i taped the entire thing 
it is a very well acted and done tv movie 
judith light is one of my favorite actresses and i think she does a superb job in this film ! 
i keep watching it over and over 
it 's a sad movie , but very good 
if you have not seen this movie , i definitely recommend it ! 
she is as lovely as usual , this cutie ! 
still it 's quite interesting and entertaining to follow 
\) recommend with confidence ! 
this movie is well balanced with comedy and drama and i thoroughly enjoyed myself 
it was a riot to see hugo weaving play a sex obsessed gay real estate salesman who uses his clients' houses for his trysts with the flaming darren \( tom hollander \) 
\) anyway , the plot flowed smoothly and the male bonding scenes were a hoot 
the opening sequence of this gem is a classic , and the cat n mouse games that follow are a delight to watch 
fans of the genre will be in heaven 
lange had become a great actress 
it looked like a wonderful story
